## ⚙️ How It Works

The password is evaluated based on the following rules:

- Minimum **8 characters**
- At least **one uppercase letter**
- At least **one lowercase letter**
- At least **one number**
- At least **one special character**

Each rule increases the strength score.  
Based on the score, the password is classified as:

| Score | Strength |
|------|----------|
| 0–2  | Weak ❌ |
| 3–4  | Medium ⚠️ |
| 5    | Strong ✅ |

## 🧠 JavaScript Concepts Used

- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling (`onkeyup`)
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Conditional Logic
- Real-time UI updates

## 🔒 Security Note

⚠️ This project performs **client-side validation only**.  
In real-world applications:
- Passwords must be validated again on the **server side**
- Passwords should be **hashed** using algorithms like `bcrypt` or `argon2`
